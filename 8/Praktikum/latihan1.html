    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>
        The <span>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span>Sebelas Maret University
        </span>, Surakarta is an <span>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span>
        which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in
        producing <span>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is
        planned to take shelter in the management of the <span>Engineering and Vocational Education
        (PTK)</span>
        department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is
        under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are
        <span>prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better
        if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as
        <span>Building Engineering Education</span>, and <span>Engineering Education</span>. To meet
        the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK
        department, PTIK will conduct <span>resource sharing with the mathematics study
        program</span>.
